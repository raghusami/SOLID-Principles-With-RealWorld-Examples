# 🚀 SOLID Principles with Real-World Examples in C#

## 📌 Overview  
This repository demonstrates all **SOLID principles** with **real-world C# examples**, helping developers write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.  

## 🎯 Why SOLID?  
Adhering to **SOLID** principles improves:  
✅ **Code Maintainability** – Reduces complexity and makes modifications easier.  
✅ **Scalability** – Helps design extensible systems.  
✅ **Testability** – Makes unit testing more effective.  
✅ **Readability** – Enhances code clarity and collaboration.

## 🏆 SOLID Principles Explained  

### 1️⃣ **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
💡 *A class should have only one reason to change.*  
✅ Example: Separating **business logic** from **data access**.  

### 2️⃣ **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
💡 *A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.*  
✅ Example: Using **interfaces and inheritance** to extend functionality without modifying existing code.  

### 3️⃣ **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
💡 *Derived classes should be replaceable for their base classes without breaking the application.*  
✅ Example: Avoiding **method overrides** that change expected behavior.  

### 4️⃣ **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
💡 *Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.*  
✅ Example: Creating **specific** interfaces instead of **large, bloated** ones.  

### 5️⃣ **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
💡 *High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.*  
✅ Example: Using **dependency injection** instead of directly instantiating dependencies.
